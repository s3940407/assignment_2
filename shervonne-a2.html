        <p>My name is Shervonne (student id: s3940407) and I am a group member of “Turbulent and
others”. I am an international first year Bachelor in IT student in RMIT from Malaysia. My
hobbies are taking pictures of nature and discovering my creativity of aesthetics. My passion in
IT started at a young age where technology had a constant development every year which has
made me started on comparing the latest equipment with its previous models. Being a first-year
student, my IT skills are limited as I am still learning on different programming languages and
developing new skills every day. </p>
