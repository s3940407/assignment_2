        <p>“An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement” (Synopsis). The current technology that autonomous driving relies on are “sensors, actuators, complex algorithms, machine learning systems, and powerful processors to execute software” (Synopsis). Today’s society has already partly integrated fully autonomous vehicles, with self-driving trucks being used in the mining industry already, with “Caterpillar’s autonomous trucks safely hauled over 3 billion tonnes of material in just 7 years of operation” (Tomorrows World Today). In today’s society, many people are rejecting of new technology when they come along, this was the case with the rise in blue light technology, electric cars and even electricity, this is the case that “they do not like change, they do not want to have to learn to use a new technology, or simply because they are recalcitrant” (Joshi, 1991; Lapointe & Rivard, 2005; Marakas & Hornik, 1996). The current reason for this rejection of autonomous vehicles is the many cases that occur in which the morals of AI are questioned, as many people believe it does not have the right or even capacity to make decisions that could cause damage to other people’s lives. Regarding the effectiveness of these new systems, “there are 9.1 self-driving car accidents per million miles driven, while the same rate is 4.1 crashes per million miles for regular vehicles” (The National Law Review). As a result of this statistic and the negative emotions many people have towards autonomous vehicles, it is safe to say that to move forward, companies who are currently in the development of entering these vehicles into markets must make significant contributions towards enhancing software and improving the safety of these vehicles for them to ever have a positive outlook from the public.
  A self-driving car can be described as an ecosystem of different technologies working together to enable a car to properly remain on a road, whilst also abiding by all the traffic laws and maintaining a good relationship with other vehicles on the roads. Autonomous vehicles use a “combination of sensors, cameras, radar, and artificial intelligence (AI) to travel between destinations without a human operator” (Ben Lutkevich). Autonomous vehicles have a large amount of sensor technology, of which is used to see the environment around them. Companies that are actively investing time and resources into the development of autonomous vehicles enable an approach called Machine Learning Algorithms to take control of them, and this allows the vehicles to spend time on roads, and then take input in how they can alter their driving in the future if any mistakes were to be made. Classification algorithms are also used to help these vehicles alongside sensors to see their environment and determine the best way to navigate to the destination. The technology around Machine Learning Algorithms is very prevalent in todays automated society, as they are used in customer service using chat bots to communicate with customers without the need of an employee to overlook the chats, as well as recommendation engines, which use “past consumption behaviour data” (IBM) to better recommend consumers products which they would likely be attracted to buy. These algorithms working together with technologies over time will improve the way we see autonomous vehicles, and therefore may change the way we view them.

      <h2>What is the likely impact?</h2>
      </div>
    <div class="personal2body">
      <div class="personal2para">
        <p>Autonomous vehicles in the modern day have already begun changing the way we see transport, however the possibilities for the future are endless, as developments in its technology can lead to not only autonomy in transport on roads, but also in vehicles in flight, allowing for them to takeover take-off, flight, and landings as well as transit to terminals.
The idea that every car on the road in the future would be autonomous is seen as both good and scary. Every can on the road that would be able to communicate with each other properly without the need of drivers could harbour the possibility of a future where accidents are nearly unheard of, and traffic can run more smoothly in prime time due to minimal human errors on the roads. Benefits that can arise from this also include emergency services being able to quickly go through roads with traffic as many cars would react in a way that makes suitable room for emergency vehicles.However, the thought that all cars on the road are autonomous is scary considering the security risks that come with it, both for the whole network and the individual cars. If a whole network is breached, all vehicles will become vulnerable, bringing the question as to how companies and governments will create solutions to these problems before they arise, and how they will convince consumers that these solutions are viable. If technology improves, then autonomy can be handed to other vehicles such as airplanes, in which pilots would no longer be required, and delays may be reduced as errors can be minimised, potentially reducing the costs of flying.

      <h2>How will this affect you?</h2>

        <p>The future of autonomous transport will affect everyone, including myself. It will affect whether in the future I will need the skills of driving my own car, or it will be done for me. The need for autonomous is vehicles is high, but it is undoubted that there are people such as me who prefer to drive themselves instead of sitting and waiting to be brought to a destination.
This may mean that in the future, I may have potential regulations placed on me as to where I am allowed to drive myself, as it is possible that autonomous vehicles being a new norm, would be the preferred mode of transport everyone takes.
