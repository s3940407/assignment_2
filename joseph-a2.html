          <p>I am Joseph Elie Moussi, Australian/Greek/Lebanese 20 year old that used to live overseas between Greece and Lebanon for 10 years before moving back to Australia after Covid hit. I obtained my VCE for year 12 with an economic stream from the academy of Paris. In 2021 I studied a bachelor of Software engineering at RMIT for three semesters before enrolling in the Bachelor of IT. I can fluently read and write five language including English, French, Greek, Arabic and Turkish. I love politics and economics and every time I meet someone I tend to ask them what their background is and try to learn about their culture as much as I can. In terms of this course, in particular, I am looking forward to learning the different aspects of the IT world and moreover, I believe that this degree will expose me to more information. I have already gained more knowledge about IT systems, since having studied the bachelor of software engineering which showed me the coding side of the IT world and has helped to show me that I am more interested in the technical, infrastructural and real-life IT side such as networking… which are my expectations of this course, as well as continuing with coding. </p>

          <p>These 3 tests, would help me focus with the group and retain info and contribute, specially since my best learning style is auditory, conversations, meetings…
Moreover it shows on the test that extraversion is dominant at 67%, where I engage with other, which can help within a group setting to engage and bring ideas to the table and having 77% on agreeableness would be a positive since I would be able to cooperate with my team mates.
