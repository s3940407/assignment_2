        <p>My name is Theo Constas, I am 19 years old, and I am from Melbourne, Australia. Apart of this assignment, I am apart of "Turbulent and Others", my group that I am working with for this assignment.
I graduated at Overnewton Anglican Community College and began studying at RMIT in 2021 in a Bachelor of Business course majoring in Marketing.
I am a 3rd generation immigrant as all my grandparents immigrated from Greece to start a new life in Australia.
I used to find difficulty finding hobbies to stick to but over time I found that I enjoyed Tennis, which however I dropped right before entering senior level competition and instead begun training in the gym for a source of fitness.
My goals for the future are to become wealthy to the point where I could pass down wealth to give future generations a somewhat more comfortable lifestyle. Goals for myself are to also explore the world, visiting countries for their unique cultures, languages and nature.

      <h2>Personality Tests</h2>

    <div class="personaltitle2">
      <h3>Myers-Briggs</h3>
      </div>
    <div class="personalbody">
      <div class="personalpara">
        <p>The 16 personalities test results labelled me as an entertainer, stating that I love being around friends and soaking up attention and having a fun time, whilst also ensuring that those around me are having just as great of a time.
  This test labelled me as 70% extroverted, as well as 58% observant, showing my ability to speak when I need to and hold good conversations whilst also having the ability to get things done when they need to. This can greatly benefit a teamwork situation.</p>

      <image class="personalimage2" src="vark.png">
      <div class="personal2para">
        <p>The Vark Questionnaire was used as a test for the learning style was used to determine my learning style. It asked which forms information sharing were easiest to learn from, and the test results in the end stated that my learning preferences were multimodal.
Multimodal means that I prefer to learn from multiple sources of information at once, including visual, audible and of example from others.
This can be appropriate in a team setting as conversing and sharing information can be made easier by myself to others, as well as better used in presentations.
The results also show my desire for trial and error, sharing that I prefer to make mistakes in order to better improve my work.</p>

      <h3>Creativity</h3>
      </div>
    <div class="personalbody">
      <div class="personalpara">
        <p>The creativity test which I took was from AULIVE titled “test my creativity”, which gave me a score of 54.11, lower than the average score of 62.83. Although below average, the test ranked my curiosity, paradox and complexity at a higher level than connection, persistence and boldness.
This means that I may want to change things that are considered the norm and can find relationships between information that I am given. This can help with problem solving that may occur in the situation of being in a team.</p>

      <h3>Personality</h3>

    <div class="personal2body">
      <div class="personal2para">
        <p>
Apart of a group assessment, being 70% extroverted benefits greatly as it allows me to speak openly and engage properly in a social matter. Communication is seen as the greatest skill needed for working in groups, as that is being tests in group assessments, and being extroverted helps in the sense that communication is not an issue that has to be overcome.
My balance between turbulence and assertiveness is good in a group as it can allow myself to drive people to work to their best, whilst not always wasting time on overthinking that things could always be better and be able to trust that everyone including myself has done a good job.
My high level of preference towards Aural information being used as a main source can allow for more clear information to be conveyed over calls and in person, allowing for work to better done in the right environments, benefitting the efforts of the group.</p>
