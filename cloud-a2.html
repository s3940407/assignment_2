      <h2>IT Technology: Cloud Computing</h2>

    <h3>What does it do?</h3>
    </div>
  <div class="personalbody">
    <div class="personalpara">
      <p>Cloud computing’s main purpose is to device storage, databases, software, analytics
as well as other platforms via the internet. Its main purpose is to deliver services
without the beed to be physically present close to a hardware.

    <h3>3 Types of cloud computing</h3>
    </div>
  <div class="personal2body">
    <div class="personal2para">
      <p>Private clouds are mainly created from IT infrastructure that is not owned by the end user, Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services(AWS), Google Cloud, IBM cloud and Microsoft Azure are the largest public cloud providers.
</p>

  <div class="personaltitle2">
    <h3>What is the state of the art for this new technology?</h3>
    </div>
  <div class="personalbody">
    <div class="personalpara">
      <p>It is a technology that I revolutionary, because it is removing many obstacles from developers, companies, since no one has to be physically in close premises to be able to work on the same project, moreover it is very cost effective, since it reduces the hosts cost to be able to host a server, they can do that by using AWS for example, and they are the ones that should handle all of the rest and all of that is done only by paying a fee for AWS.</p>

<p>Moreover cloud computing has many benefits that makes it a state of the art new technology:</p>
<p>It is very agile, that give very easy access to many types and ranges of technologies that allows us to innovate faster and build anything without any restrictions. It is a very efficient technology that allows someone to upload projects in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>Usually with projects, we should provision the levels of activity of the business, whereas with cloud computing we don’t need to do that instead we provision the amount of resources that we actually need, which we can increase or decrease depending on how the business need it.</p>


<p>At the moment the cloud adoption is on the rise, the global public cloud services spending reached $332.3 Billion in 2021 that rose from $270 billion in 2020, that is a 18% increase in one and is set to grow even more with the change that has been happening in the world, and the increase of digitalisation of the world and companies.(What is Cloud Computing, 2022)</p>

<p>This rise has been a key factor that change business technology, where cloud services have been integrated into many business operations and became the core structure of businesses.</p>

<p>Cloud services has got a bright future ahead, and its growth in the near future is a no brainer, here are multiple scenarios of what could happen to the future of cloud computing:</p>

<p>1- Multi-cloud:</p>
<p>Where a company or a business would be using more than one cloud service, where the services is sourced from different vendors, and distributes the work across multiple cloud environments.
Based on recent data more than 93% of enterprises have a multi-cloud strategy.(What is Cloud Computing, 2022)</p>

<p>2- Expansion of Data Storage Capacities.</p>

<p>Demand from consumer customers and enterprises and business will grow, hence the one of the main focus of the future cloud computing is to increase the data storage unit capacities.
Cloud storage would be faster cheaper and have more availability for customers that would have more companies to choose from, that will introduce more opportunities for innovation.</p>

<p>3- Increased Security:</p>

<p>The innovation in the cloud environments are pushing better security infrastructure, reducing and eliminating security risks, since the cloud is integrated with AI and Machine Learning, to help with the process of threat detection and protection.</p>

<p>The future of cloud is going to be robust and resilient, because in 2022, more than 95% of cloud security faults would be the customers fault. (Future of Cloud Computing - 8 Trends & Predictions, 2022)

    <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
    </div>
  <div class="personal2body">
    <div class="personal2para">
      <p>This development would impact both consumer customers and business enterprises on a daily bases.</p>

<p>Cloud computing and IoT both help each other for success, the number of connected things and devices saw a huge increase from 14.2 billion devices in 2021 to 25 billion in 2021(Future of Cloud Computing - 8 Trends & Predictions, 2022)</p>

<p>IoT is used rot develop and deploy applications on the cloud, which helps with high performance to interact and connect, that makes the IoT a cloud computing trend that affects the general public by allow them to connect quicker, better and faster to other people or to their own devices, as well as enterprises and companies, which helps business and trade, helps with projection of trends, and helps connect different companies in an easier and more secure way.</p>

<p>Moreover, Artificial Intelligence(AI), is one of the most popular trends in computing which is integrated with cloud computing.
The global market value of AI will surpass 89 billion $ annually(Future of Cloud Computing - 8 Trends & Predictions, 2022), which makes it impossible for an organisation not to be using and adapting their technologies with AI, which cloud computing helps increase the impact and the scope of AI, increases efficiency and makes workflow smooth.
Both AI and cloud computing would have a big impact on businesses, since it increases the skills and power of the tech.</p>

<p>As the cloud expands, it will influence corporate technology in the future and offer a number of advantages.</p>

<p>Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, edge computing, and containers can be used to explain the increase in cloud spending.</p>

<p>Businesses that want to expand must be ready to embrace the future. It's crucial to stay current with cloud technology developments.

    <h3>How will this affect you</h3>
    </div>
  <div class="personalbody">
    <div class="personalpara">
      <p>On a daily basis, cloud computing will help me eventually when I will get a job in the IT field, it would make it easier to work remotely rom any country under any timezone without having to be physically in an office next to servers and drivers to be able to upload and deploy work.
It would affect me in many different other ways with its integration with AI and IoT, which are a very important aspect of a modern life, having everything connected, from phones, to watches, to fridges to even toasters, having an easier cheaper and more reliable and safer access to IoT, using cloud computing, would help.
Even to store some projects, or apps or deploy a project that I have been working on the different types of services, and the different companies as well as the competition on the market, makes it more convenient, have quick turnarounds and much easier and cheaper and better alternatives for purchases.
In addition, as a student, cloud computing has helped me access data anywhere at any time, I can join online activities, manage my classes, my courses, thru the cloud, without having to install anything, helping the universities and other institutions as well, to store a vast amount of data securely without having to install a complicated and expensive infrastructure to keep everything running.</p>

<p>Moreover it would help my uncle who works in tech, he’s the founder of a tech start-up and him moving to cloud computing will reduce the cost to manage and maintain his IT systems, he can manage better his deployments with his developers from different countries, rather than purchasing very expensive systems and equipments for his business, helping him reduce costs by using cloud computing service form a provider.
