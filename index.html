        <p>Many of the challenges that industries and the general population are currently facing or may face in the future can be resolved and offset through the support of skilled labour. This is why the Turbulent and others group have decided to introduce the app “Matcher''. Matcher is an app that will help in building stronger industry connections and help provide a platform where businesses can achieve their objectives in a more productive and efficient manner. Matcher derives concepts from apps and websites such as Linkdln, Instagram and Tinder however using a more formal approach. The app is targeted for small businesses providing them with a platform to connect business owners with labour allowing for owners to access a source of resources more easily without having to waste time and resources on searching for labour. Matcher will help with building links between businesses and available labour based on what skills a worker has to offer and what a manager is looking for. The links will be built on a series of qualities, some including experience, personality (whether they have strong collaboration or communication skills), availability etc. Once a link has been made based on the similarities, Matcher users will be able to swipe left (unsuccessful match) or right (successful match). If the user has swiped right the other party will be notified of this interest and given the option to accept or deny by swiping left or right. If the user approves of the match and swipes right then the user and the business owner will have a private chat allowing them to discuss expectations and the role more in depth as well as the candidate's experiences, while also being able to answer questions before a formal job offer or interview can be determined.
        </p>

  <p>In Australia, small businesses make up a large contribution to the economy, with, of all businesses, “98%” of them or “2.35 million” (ABA) are small businesses. Of those businesses, ones such as real estate, financial services and retail, who usually interact with consumers the most, may seek out social media to find more ways to market themselves in this modernising world. From these 3 industries, “615,990” (ABA) small businesses may still be in search of social media managers. These statistics show that there will always be a demand for these services, and there can be easier ways to provide this service to these small businesses.<p>

  <p>Once the user has downloaded Matcher from the app store they will be provided with 2 options either business owner or available labour. After the user has made a selection they will be directed to a form requiring them to fill out personal information. If the available labour option has been selected a form some of the questions they will be asked about their availability, if the individual is looking for a part time position or a full time position, their previous job experience with a short job description on what did they do during their time there and the industry they are interested in working in. There will be short answer sections in the form where individuals would have to write why they think they are a strong candidate and what skills they have that others may not have to make them suitable for the job. In addition to those questions, there would be a section where individuals are able to choose from the options provided on their preferred radius range of their workspace, their mode of transportation to get to work and their preferred mode of working such as remotely or in an office space or always on the go. They would also be asked to fill in their employer expectations and their salary range expectation alongside with their personality type according to the Myers Briggs 16 personality type results. In the last section of the form, they would require to provide extra information on the languages that they are able to speak whether its basic level or an advanced level, their future leadership interests if any and also if they would be interested in travelling overseas for a business trip.
  </p>
  <p>However, if the business owner option is selected they will be provided with a form asking them to fill out the role description, employee expectations, salary range that could be provided, the work day schedule, a brief description on the skills required for the job, location and also the promotion prospects of the job. Once this form has been filled out the user will be taken to a page with the profiles of either available labour if the business owner mode is selected or the profiles of different roles made available by business owners.
  </p>
  <p>Since users are entering personal, sensitive information Matcher will protect all information created by users through encryption and security which will constantly be maintained and improved to ensure risks are kept at a minimum.
  </p>
  <p>The interface will be shown like Instagram or TikTok, where users can scroll to different profiles and find the information. Managers will only see small businesses, and small businesses will only see managers. The user will then be able to swipe right (if they are interested in the role) or left (if not interested). The app will contain an icon which if selected by the user will give updates on the stage of the matches they have made, (whether the business owner or labour worker has swiped right on the match or swiped left). If a business owner has swiped left they will be required to fill in a short description as to why they have made this choice, the information provided by the business owner will remain private and will only be used to help Matcher to provide more suitable recommendations. To further simplify the connections and provide the most eligible possibilities, Matcher will contain a ranking system that will be out of 5 stars, the higher the ranking the more closely the workers skill aligns with the job opportunity and therefore will be positioned higher in a business owner or available labours possibilities. For conversations to begin between both parties (business owners and available labour), they both need to swipe right on one another. This helps to avoid the inboxes for both users being overflowed with irrelevant messages and instead ensure messages received are relevant to both.
  </p>
  <p>This can also allow managers to determine the level of pay that they require in terms of competitiveness and in what percentile they are in the level of skill they have in terms of other managers on the app. Another system of ranking is a medal system, where a business can rank a manager with a gold/silver/bronze medal based on the work they received and success of the social media manager’s input. The medals will be put on the managers profiles to show how many they have of each medal to show their overall success in managing small business social media.</p>
  <p>Since business owners and available labour is matched based on skills and industry experience, in the cases where available labour users may want to branch out and experience work within industries they don't have experience in, Matcher can still provide a platform to provide industry links. The app will contain a request section for business owners, within this section will be a list of available labour that may not have the specific skill sets that business owners are looking for however in cases where there is a need for labour for example due to a labour shortage, business owners can still accept requests from available labour who may require more training due to limited experience.   </p>
  </p>
  <p>If need be, there will be an option where a social media manager or a business can search up specific names of each other to request work instead of relying on the algorithm of the app to help them find each other. There would be a separate page for a party to see likes that have happened in a time of inactivity to better find matches. This page would allow the user to like or dislike a profile a viewing the skills and offers of the business or manager, and disliking will cause the profile to never appear on said users main page again. If the user have accidentally swiped wrongly on someone, there will be a history section in the settings where the users are able to go back and change their swipe direction in case of any change of mind.
  </p>
  <p>There will also be a page exclusively for managers, allowing them to work together and discuss on what type of employees they are seeking for in case if one individual does not pop up on one of the business’ feeds. For individuals who may not have the skill set that is required for the job, they will be able to connect with the company they hope to get a position from by using the “request section” implemented specifically for individuals who wish to talk to the specific companies hoping for a negotiation.
  </p>
  <p>A system for managers that allows them to work together will contain features for making work easier, increasing the quality of work available for small businesses and also providing better opportunities for unemployed individuals that may not have much experience. Managers may be able to collaborate, by finding other managers through a similar like/swipe page on the main screen, and collaborate with one another, through sharing ideas, or recommendations to small businesses through each other’s connections. Managers may also try to form shared accounts, so larger small businesses who may be looking for more traffic will seek out 2 instead of one manager. This feature will allow for better access to resources for small businesses and managers alike.
  </p>
  <p>When both parties have swiped right and are brought to a private chat to discuss their expectations and conditions, Matcher will have a security program where there will be specific words that are considered to be sensitive words and the message would not be able to be sent. This function is inspired by the social media app TikTok where messages that include the sensitive words would not be able to be sent and this function is implemented so there would not be any inappropriate contents in the app that may make a user uncomfortable as the app is mainly only for business related and it is strictly formal. Private chats will also be encrypted like the information provided in the app so that sensitive information that might be included in messages between the business and the individual would not have the risk of it leaking out. In addition, the app would have another security function where both parties are not allowed to take screenshots of the chats for privacy reasons. If any of those parties tried to capture a screenshot of the chats, the picture captured will show a plain black screen.
  </p>
  <p>The app would also require verification of the user who has created an account by providing a picture of their face without any filters and it would go through a short scanning procedure where the app would use the camera function to scan the user’s face immediately after they have uploaded a picture. In any case the user would like to change their profile photo, they would then have to go through the verification process again to reduce the risk of identity theft.
  </p>
  <p>Both parties will be able to have a video chat using the video or audio call function in the app so individuals would not need to provide their contact details other than their emails to provide maximum professionalism and also maximum security to both of them.
  </p>
  <p>Skills required to create the app will include strong communication and collaboration skills amongst app developers to ensure that the app is able to function and reflects the overview of the developers. The app will also need a risk analyst to identify the possible risks that may threaten Matcher and ways to not only resolve them but to build safeguards which can prevent them. The app will need a programmer to organise the data within the app as well as a designer in order to create a visually aesthetic app that contains icons to easily access data. An app developer will also be required to use HTML and CSS when building this app, through the use of JAVA an C++.
