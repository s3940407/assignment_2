        <p>Taking concepts from apps/websites such as LinkedIn, Instagram and Tinder, this idea is more formal and for small businesses to be able to quickly access a source of resources easily without having to search as hard. This project will provide an easy link in which small businesses and users can look through each other’s information, and then swipe left or right depending on how they agree with the information provided to them, and then matches can be made based of similar needs between entities in which a user and a business seeking a social media manager can be in contact.</p>

  <p>In Australia, small businesses make up a large contribution to the economy, with, of all businesses, “98%” of them or “2.35 million” (ABA) are small businesses. Of those businesses, ones such as real estate, financial services and retail, who usually interact with consumers the most, may seek out social media to find more ways to market themselves in this modernising world. From these 3 industries, “615,990” (ABA) small businesses may still be in search of social media managers. These statistics show that there will always be a demand for these services, and there can be easier ways to provide this service to these small businesses.<p>

  <p>When creating an account, the user can state whether they are applying to listed as a small business or as someone who has an interest in managing a small business’ social media. Social media managers can create a description like that of a resume, which describes all the skills that they can bring to the table, and experience that they hold, and can link their own resumes, as well as past work. Social media managers can add in what is expected for themselves, in terms of pay, however it could always be negotiated. Small businesses similarly can add the work that is required from managers and the pay that they are willing to give out to potential managers. All information created by users will be encrypted and security will be maintained and improved to ensure risks and kept at a minimum.</p>
  <p>The interface will be shown like Instagram or TikTok, where users can scroll to different profiles and find the information. Managers will only see small businesses, and small businesses will only see managers. There would be the ability to like or swipe right on a profile if they wish to interact with one another. However, to begin contact, both parties must like each other’s profile as it shows they approve of the experience/work expected and want to build communications. If need be, there will be an option where a social media manager or a business can search up names of eachother to request work instead of relying on algorithm of the app to help them find eachother. There would be a separate page for a party to see likes that have happened in a time of inactivity to better find matches. This page would allow the user to like or dislike a profile a viewing the skills and offers of the business or manager, and disliking will cause the profile to never appear on said users main page again. There will also be a page exclusively for managers, allowing them to work together.
  </p>
  <p>A system for managers that allows them to work together will contain features for making work easier, increasing the quality of work available for small businesses. Managers may be able to collaborate, by finding other managers through a similar like/swipe page on the main screen, and collaborate with one another, through sharing ideas, or recommendations to small businesses through each other’s connections. Managers may also try to form shared accounts, so larger small businesses who may be looking for more traffic will seek out 2 instead of one manager. This feature will allow for better access to resources for small businesses and managers alike. </p>
  <p>There will also be a rating system, through the typical 5-star system, where a small business can rate managers work when they are complete or as they are doing it, to allow other small businesses to have an understanding on the level of work that they may receive when hiring someone. This can also allow managers to determine the level of pay that they require in terms of competitiveness and in what percentile they are in the level of skill they have in terms of other managers on the app. Another system of ranking is a medal system, where a business can rank a manager with a gold/silver/bronze medal based on the work they received and success of the social media manager’s input. The medals will be put on the managers profiles to show how many they have of each medal to show their overall success in managing small business social medias. </p>
