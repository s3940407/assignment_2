        <p>In our group we early on started a shared google document which was very beneficial in sharing and editing other group members' works. Through the shared google document where we would establish lists about what needed to be completed before our next meeting. Through setting these clear expectations it limited any confusion or miscommunications on each member's responsibilities so that when we had discussions they were focused on content related questions or group progression as opposed to determining what each member has to do. Having a group chat on messages was also something that worked well for our group since it was checked more regularly, although not ideal as our main source of communication. Each group member's schedules were able to be determined and based on that we were more efficient in the planning of task timelines, when we should have tasks completed and when can meetings be set, while also being able to to update one another on our progress on our individual tasks. One thing we have found as a group is the importance of a group calendar to track the progress of the overall assignment since small sections of the overall assignment were overlooked. Having a calendar would have ensured that deadlines were met more effectively since we would have been able to be more organised in terms of how we were progressing as a group and which tasks needed to be prioritised over the others. The Github log of activity is not an accurate reflection of the groups work on the assignment since due to differences in formatting and other issues meant that rather than each member pushing their files onto Github, we loaded our individual tasks onto the shared google doc and delegated the responsibility to one member (Theo) to load this onto the website. One thing that was surprising within the group is rather than having only one chair person that leads our group discussions, we instead had different members taking lead over different stages in our group based on the tasks that they were strong in and meant the leader would change during different meetings. Another surprising aspect of the group was to see how each of us had such different personalities and interests within IT were still able to collaborate and find similarities within our approaches to IT.

        <p>Our group was successful in delegating tasks to each group member to create an even level of contribution from each member. Through to-do lists written on our shared google doc we were able to establish the groups agendas and deadlines which limited any confusion about each group member's responsibility and tasks. This meant that each member knew what exactly they had to complete before the next call, which meant no time was wasted in between our meetings of group members wondering what they needed to complete. We could have improved our communication skills, where once the larger tasks such as the reports had been delegated for individual group members, we could have set time to discuss how smaller tasks needed to be handled collaboratively. One thing that was surprising is how even though we had such different personalities we were still able to work together well. The Github log of activity is not an accurate reflection of each member's contribution since due to formatting issues, one person had to be responsible for collecting the rest of the groups information and adding it to the website. One thing I have learned from group work is the importance of time management and ensuring that each person is on the same stage in their set individual tasks so that tasks that require collaborative work can be completed.

        <p>From originally sitting on the table with the group, it was easy to tell that we would work well with eachother in the group assignment to come. We all begun to know eachother well, and were cohesive in our communication to eachother. In terms of starting the group assignment, it is obvious to the group that we should have been alot more prepared in terms of time management, starting at a point where we were very unsure if we had enough time to complete the work. Starting the assignment however, we were quick to list what needed to be done, and by who and when. However, as time went on, it became clear that communication was not a strong point of the group, as only a few meetings were made over call, and instead much of the communication was made in class or over messages that were shown in another PDF. Ability to make decisions quickly was a strong point of the group however, as in the most recent class before the submission, we found that merging our work together and having them link properly was a problem and we were very inexperienced in certain matters, however, this issue was overcome as we decided for everyone to complete their own work and delegate the responsibility of putting it all together to a single person. Overall, I am happy with the group that I am currently working with and have no doubts.

        <p>It was great working with my class mates on a group project together, even though we had some issues in the beginning, to organize and delegate tasks, we managed to re-arrange the meetings thru teams and in person, we delegated tasks evenly throughout different people, having each one working on a different task, that would contribute evenly in the total outcome of the assignment. Even though in the beginning communication was poor, we managed to use Teams and imessages to communicate better in real time to accelerate the progress of our work and general outcome of the assignment.
Creating a google docs helped us contribute and see the progress of our work, helped us divide and allocate different parts of the project to help create a clear outlook on responsibilities that have been shared.
Creating the github, allowed us to push and track the progress of our website, although we had issued with the pulling requests, we managed to work together and comminute and contribute evenly and give a final push to the final code.

        <p>Being able to work on this assignment with everyone in this group was such a pleasure. At the beginning we struggled to organise times for meetings and assigning tasks due to our different schedules. However, by using Teams and seeing each other in person, we were able to pull through and set tasks for each other. IMessage also helped us communicate better to one another about our progress and our overall assessment. Additionally, Google Docs allowed us to share and see each other’s progress whilst also being able to comment and give feedback to each other’s work.
Even though it was clear communication was not something we were good at, as a group we came to final decisions quickly and efficiently. We also all got along very well making it easy for everyone to agree with one another and have no conflicts.
Issues did arise when it came to linking our work together as there was trial and error with the programs we used. Nevertheless, we settled on assigning one person the responsibility.
One thing I learnt from group work is that organisation and time management is incredibly important in getting things done in an effective way
