        <p>Blockchain technology is a decentralized system where information is recorded on a public ledger and distributed peer to peer to ensure security, it records transactions and tracks assets for different corporations networks. Cryptocurrency refers to digital currency whose transactions are managed and maintained by blockchain technology. However blockchain technologies capabilities have extended beyond finances and have been able to improve efficiency and security for a range of different sectors. For example the employment of blockchain technology within supply chain management through providing businesses with access to information through shared networks has helped in limiting the risks of miscommunication or transfer data errors. Moreover, improving efficiency and quality of products since less time can be spent validating data and instead focused on improved product quality. Furthermore, blockchain has helped to enable peer to peer financial transactions which have helped in aiding corporations such as Walmart, where the Canadian cooperation’s employment of blockchain technology has led to less than 1% of discrepancies relating to salary payments as opposed to 70% prior to the adoption of the technology (Harvard business review). Blockchain technology has also been used in relation to stock exchanges when facilitating the settlement or transfer of securities. Blockchain technology currently can help support industries relating to tracking of data and information accurately since the ledger is unchangeable, this can also help to avoid fraud since transactions can be traced, limiting liability. It has also been able to increase the rate of data access and transfer since a centralized third party is not involved in the transactions, which also reduces costs since the cut of transactions going towards the third party who are no longer needed in some transactions.</p>

  <p>Blockchain technology features have the potential to revolutionize the management of health records within the healthcare sector. One of the industries greatest struggles is the securing and standardization of data. The adoption of blockchain technology can help in improving the integrity of personal health information and records by improving patient access to their records through a distributed shared ledger as opposed to requesting healthcare providers. The data securely contained on the ledger may also be accessible by healthcare stakeholders allowing for the transfer of accurate patient information, limiting transferring of details/update issues and improving the accuracy of medical advice and actions provided to patients.</p>

  <p>Blockchain technology has already successfully been applied to companies such as Provenance relating to the tracking of the origin of foods consumed by customers. This technology over the coming years will be able to provide greater transparency within the agriculture industry where consumers will be able to see the processes their food went through before they consume their meals.</p>

  <p>The future of cryptocurrency within the next 3 years remains difficult to predict since it is a relatively new industry. For the successful expansion and implementation of cryptocurrency, it will require strong policies surrounding regulations to ensure it is safer and accessible, for example this may include new legislation. This implementation will also help to provide a positive public sentiment surrounding the cryptocurrency structure prompting greater use. For blockchain technologies expansion in the future to be possible and to ensure management of large databases, stronger cybersecurity updates will need to be made to ensure security of transactions. Cryptographic functions protect the security of information therefore, each transaction recorded on the blockchain where the data is encrypted. Blockchain technology requires a means of computing to store its networks, more specifically it relies on distributed ledger technology. Bitcoin transactions are digitally sighted and stored in a peer to peer network of nodes</p>

  <p>As blockchain technology continues to expand and gain popularity it will potentially help improve the security of data transfer while also improving traceability and transparency. The implementation of blockchain technology will change the way transactions are conducted, where rather than a centralized system where transactions are verified by third parties (banks), transactions are recorded on a digital ledger. This will largely affect the roles of banks within society and lead to many redundancies relating to the responsibilities that banks have currently, especially banks that rely on fee revenue. For example when transferring money overseas we have to pay a wire transfer fee and an additional fee which the bank takes a share of as well as the receiving bank on top of the payment towards the exchange rate fees. Whereas transactions conducted through blockchain will not limit all these additional fees towards a trusted third party since transactions don’t have to be verified, they will also help to limit the time taken for transfers to occur. This will potentially positively influence many industries globally allowing for more efficient transfers, therefore boosting productivity. The rising popularity of crypto has led to an increase in demand in the tech industry “to facilitate the aggressive growth plans.” (Alex McClymont, Senior Manager at Michael Page). Furthermore this growth in confidence within crypto where “50% of crypto investors would be conformable using it to pay for online shopping” (GWI core Q2 2018-Q2 2021) will mean a decreased need of manual verification will mean that many people may lose their jobs to machines and demand will increases for labour skilled with blockchain understanding</p>

  <p>One of the most significant ways blockchain will affect daily life will be the way in which transactions are conducted as stated above. Not only transactions between family and friends but also when purchasing items as larger corporations around the world have started to accept cryptocurrencies as forms of payments such as KFC, pizza hut, subway (only some branches). Bitcoin payments don’t require tapping your card or entering a pin,  instead payments are conducted through QR codes. As mentioned above blockchain technology will also work to revolutionise standards of security. For example individuals' digital identity, the implementation of blockchain will mean that users have greater privacy and can secure their IDs without sharing them with third party entities. User data will be stored more safely by limiting the risk of data breaches and fraud through for example hacking passwords from online agencies. Through blockchain’s encrypted identities, not only will there be greater protection of data from hackers but also help in establishing intellectual property. Blockchains tools can be used to determine proof of ownership through the use of an IP which is another way of how this form of technology can ensure greater personal security. The volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market can have negative effects, the fact that it is not well established can negatively impact investments and consumer confidence within the market.</p>
