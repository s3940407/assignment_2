        <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting and defending devices, networks and data from getting malicious attacks online. There are many types of cybersecurity attacks which include malware, ransomware and phishing. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at money fraud and stealing sensitive and personal information.
In an interview, it is mentioned that cloud computing is a more efficient way of storing data and having services online in terms of money and time even if it does mean that it will be easier to access those sensitive data. However, a former senior intelligence officer with the Defence Intelligence Agency named Tyler Cohen Wood has a different opinion on the cybersecurity of cloud computing. She predicts that the cloud will be evaporated by the year 2031 and she “don’t think things will be in the cloud in 10 years but rather be back to on-prem'' as there will be more peer-to-peer networks where computers will be linked together to process data with equal permissions and responsibilities. Cohen Wood has also added that she thinks the cloud won't ever go away as users will most likely go back to cloud as it is “how it works” and that “history has proven that time and time again.”
In the same interview going over the subject of passwords, software company “KnowBe4” defence evangelist and hacking author, Roger Grimes said that he believes that passwords will be around at least in the near future or probably forever as passwords have many benefits to it such as it being cheap and super user-friendly. Cybersecurity speaker, Troy Hunt has also said that he hopes that password will evolve and added an example of logging onto the newer iPhones using facial recognition whilst having the 4- or 6-digit pin as a backup in case the facial recognition does not work. Hunt has also predicted that there might be more biometrics and additional authentication methods involving different devices people might have close to them.
It is also mentioned that in the year 2031, data breaches will be much more common than it is now due to the amount of data and devices to be appearing online which will only increase the possibility of breaches. The reason why cyberattacks are happening more often as time passes is simply because the attackers have ample amounts of digitalised data to access as more people are getting access and providing their data to the online world and including the Internet of Things (IoT). This can be supported by the data collected by the IoT Analytics where it has shown that there were 10 billion devices that are connected in the year 2019 and it can be tripled to 30.9 billion in the span of 5 years.

      <h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>

        <p>When it comes to large scale and supply chain breaches, experts mentioned that there might be more large-scale breaches in the future mainly caused by the same reason as mentioned previously where more people are providing their data digitally which makes those data much more accessible. (Mark Stone, 2021)
There are many other technologies and digital developments that help make cybersecurity improve and evolve such as the usage of blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is not just about bitcoin but is also a security instrument. The digital register allows for secure data and information sharing and identity authentication without having to risk the exposure of the data and information shared to strangers. Another well known technology is the cloud technology which is known to be convenient but also has been shown to be also risky. Different sets of data can be stored in one single cloud account makes it convenient but this also causes the risks of security weaknesses to users. However, technology has advanced drastically over the years and developers are trying to ensure that all data stored in the cloud are being protected against being hacked compared to previous years.
With the global pandemic that started 3 years ago, most companies made the decision to shift their workforces remotely and might continue to do so even when the situation gets better. With the increase in the number of employees working from home, the number of cybersecurity risks will also increase as home offices are known to be less protected compared to workplaces as they usually would have safety measures such as routers, firewalls and a professional IT security team. The use of two-factor authentication has also increased over the years by having a code being sent to the user via text message or email.
The healthcare industry has the highest risk of ransomware as it is said that at least one security breach has occurred daily affecting 27 million patient records. This is caused by the slow adoption of new technology and the upgrade of computing software that will further intensify the problem. On the other hand, government agencies manage to adopt new technologies such as fingerprints and biometrics to protect sensitive data making them one of the most vulnerable industries for cyberattacks. (Mishaal Khan, 2021)
Cybersecurity will not be completely automated as the current use will not replace the role of a professional. This is the reason why the demand for cyber security professionals continues to increase over the years as they are the people who will be implementing a security system and regularly updating them due to the real-time data they work with to secure sensitive information systems and personal identities.

        <p>In my daily life, I do not think that the change in cybersecurity will affect me as much negatively but it will continue educating me on the importance of protecting my personal data by reminding myself to constantly update my electronic devices as it contains most of my data and the system updates will be able to offer some security fixes and patches to my device that will help making my electronic devices much more secure. However, I would be needing to guide my family through this technological advanced day and age so that their personal data would also be protected as much as possible without having to worry about the risk of having security breaches which would be much more complicated to handle.</p>
