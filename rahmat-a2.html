        <p>My name is Rahmat Randhawa and I am part of the turbulent and others group, my student ID is s3952731, I was born in New Zealand but my ethnicity is Indian. My newest hobby is DJ'ing which actually started this year after going to a couple of house music events. By the end of the year I want to have my own deck and actually be able to mix a couple of songs. I'm very interested in the influence technological changes are having on industries and politics, for example blockchain technology. More specifically what a decentralized system will look like in our different industries. I don’t have any IT experience, apart from a digital technology course I took when I was 9 where the focus was more of filmmaking.</p>

        <p>Being a visual learner means that when assigning different tasks we can possibly create a list of tasks that need to be completed so there is greater clarity on the group's expectations.</p>

        <p>Strong agreeableness and openness can positively contribute to the group since it can allow for discussions to be held in a positive and productive approach where other group members' opinions are considered, and feel comfortable to share.</p>

        <p>General skills required as a risk analyst are strong communication and collaboration skills in order to be able to lead and delegate tasks, and through teamwork be able to problem solve when it comes to identifying and offsetting risks the institution may face. Communication, collaboration and problem solving skills were ranked very high in demand according to the 2018 burning glass report coming up within the top 5 most demanded.</p>

      <h3>IT Skills</h3>

    <div class="personal2body">
      <div class="personal2para">
        <p>SQL, JavaScript and JAVA were the 3 highest ranked IT skills in the burning glass data, which were not specified within this role however may still be used to manage risks. Based on the burning glass data my opinion has shifted a little based on my ideal job since this job doesn’t seem to have as high industry demand based on the skills required.</p>
