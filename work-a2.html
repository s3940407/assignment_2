<p>Justin Hammond works as a software engineer from home where he completes a range of tasks. He reviews and responds to code that is sent to him by his co-workers. Hammond makes sure to complete tasks set by the company before taking upon a new one, making sure to complete the easiest tasks first for example allowing customers to access certain features they weren’t before and making sure to troubleshoot code so that it works correctly. Further, he also takes part in meetings which discuss how they will achieve their task and any potential threats to completing it. Through this, it allows him to understand how he will start programming and building his code. The type of people Hammond interacts with are his co-workers/team members shown through his meetings and Pair Programming. Additionally he indirectly works with the general public. He does so by making certain features accessible to the public when customers visit their website. Hammond works from home due to covid therefore he spends most of his time working remotely. Hammon says “the bane of a software engineer’s existence” is when their build/code does not run. However, Hammond is able to work through this issue through the company’s Pair Programming. This allows him to partner up with another team member where they can watch and learn, ensuring code is constantly being reviewed and everyone is learning from each other.

        <p>Video 2 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw6utYElVFg</p>
<p>On the other hand, another IT professional named “Brown Tech” on youtube, works as a software engineer for Microsoft. He works mainly at the HQ near Seattle and sometimes at Redmond HQ. His day consists of a range of tasks such as trial and error with code, this is due to him constantly having to debug code and make changes so that the code can run smoothly. The engineer works a lot on his own and in his own space, however when he needs assistance or help with his code, he contacts colleagues about the bug and hopes to get help. Through the video it is shown that this engineer spends most of his time in different locations at the Microsoft HQ. He states he goes from building 48 to a new building so that he can have a change of scenery when working. One of the most challenging aspects of their career is debugging. The engineer says that he “hates” debugging and says that to get through it, he writes out his notes to clear his mind; this makes it easier for him to gather his thoughts. As stated earlier he will also contact his co-workers for help.
