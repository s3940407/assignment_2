        <p>My name is Alyssa-Lara Wolfer and I am also part of the turbulent and others group, and my student number is s3968552. I come from a diverse family where my mum is from the Philippines and my dad is from Germany. However I can only speak English. I graduated highschool in 2021 at Keysborough College and hope to graduate from University with a Bachelor of Information Technology before the year 2026; where I can then hopefully complete further studies and do a graduate program. RMIT is the second Uni I have attended as I used to be enrolled at Monash and did my first semester there for a Bachelor of IT and Business. </p>

        <p>Through the 3 tests completed, scoring high in agreeableness and openness will allow me to be understanding and optimistic about the process of our group's tasks, whilst openness will allow me to be accepting and willing to try new ideas that I would not have thought of. If issues or miscommunication occurs throughout our group, being an auditory learner it would be easier for me to explain things and teach others if needed.</p>

        <p>As a software engineer the baseline skills such as written and verbal communication and problem solving are important to this role. In burning glassâ€™s study, communication skills, problem solving and organizational skills were ranked top 3, writing being ranked 4. Therefore the baseline skills most in demand align with the skills in a software engineer.</p>

        <p>My dream job is a software engineer and some of the specialised skills needed for this carer were C++, graphic concepts and geometric operations and according to burning glass data SQL, Javascript and JAVA rank top 3 skills in greatest demand. Graphic design ranked 10 according to burning glass, however C++ and geometric operations were not ranked at all.</p>

        <p>Nevertheless, Burning Glass study done in March 2018 on top titles in demand, a Software Engineer ranked 11. On the studies made by Burning Glass, overall this has shifted my view on my ideal job slightly, as the skills to become a software engineer are not as high in demand compared to others, although a software engineer ranks in the middle of the study
