         <p>As of now my ideal job would be working in networking since I love the technical
           aspect of it and the real world version of IT, what happens in between the devices
           and how they are connected to the internet.</p>

           <p>One of my passions is to make devices, homes, and offices smarter using IoT and having a good connection and a great network would be a crucial foundation to her ability to make any space smarter, hence my desire to work as a senior network engineer at a big tech firm. This job advertisement grabbed my attention since working for the world’s sixth largest IT company by revenue would be a huge step up in my career, which I am willing to work hard for and dedicate myself to. Fujitsu is a company that I have known for its ambition to make people’s lives easier and better and most definitely smarter, having more than “130 000 employees helping customers in more than 180 countries”, (About Fujitsu: Fujitsu Global, 2022).</p>

            <p>This job is a full-time position to be a network engineer in Canberra for Fujitsu Australia that mostly focuses on implementing, managing and planning network communications systems (voice and Data) (Fujitsu Technology & Service Vision 2022 latest version, 2022). The aspects of conducting testing of network design, and maintaining technical expertise in all areas of network and computer hardware and software interconnection and interfacing is what excites me in terms of IT. The job itself does not require a specific number of degrees or experience, but it does require candidates to have a tertiary qualification in a relevant discipline such as the Bachelor of IT that I am currently undertaking, a high level of experience and knowledge in network-related subjects and hardware such as Cisco products, WAN technologies, Juniper and encryption technologies etc. Studying the Bachelor of IT at RMIT will be a big step to getting closer to the requirements of this role, and I would take more classes related to networking if possible in my degree so I would be exposed to more content and gain more knowledge about networking, and I would do my own research and enrol in boot camps related to networking to be able to get more experience and knowledge on the subject.  </p>
