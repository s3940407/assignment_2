     <h1>Project Idea: SB Intelligence</h1>
     <h2>Overview:</h2>
     <p style="font-size: 18px">
       The main idea of the project would be software that would help startup companies to better deal with warehousing and stock, manage stock in real-time, and see how much stock they have left and how they are dealing with supply and demand. The software would have some intelligence to predict how much demand would be expected in each season and how much stock the company should order based on previous customer behaviour (number of times the website has been visited, the items that are ordered the most, the number of people that check out their carts and the most added items to a shopping cart). This software would have an assistant that the company can communicate with using their voices, similar to interacting with a Google Assistant or Siri.</p>

     <h2>Motivation</h2>
     <p style="font-size: 18px">
       This project would help startups that are struggling with funding, and it would help big companies to manage their stock in a more efficient way. This project idea has the potential to get help from the Australian government with funding since Australia is the nerve centre of the Oceania startup ecosystem, and more than 17,000 startups a year are emerging from Australia alone, with more than 2,300 public ones (Soonicorn Club 2021: Top Tech Startups In Australia, 2022). In 2021 there were 839,978 companies that were less than one year old and an average of 365,000 new businesses each year (Australia: number new business entries 2021 | Statista, 2022). Moreover, 1 in 3 startups fail in Australia on average (Start me Up!, 2022) and this software would help these startups to save on one aspect and give them the opportunity to invest in other parts of their company by making this software as affordable as possible and as efficient as possible.
     </p>

     <h2>Description:</h2>
     <p style="font-size: 18px">
       For the project, it would have an interface that is very user-friendly and that is connected to the database on a live basis to check how the stock is going and how much stock is coming in, how much is going out, and how much is being used in production. Moreover, upon user request, it would show some graphs and diagrams concerning future predictions of the stock, while not overwhelming the user with a lot of non-understandable numbers and percentages. The webpage would be accessible with a desktop device such as a laptop or computer, with tablets, and phones for it to be more convenient, many users can have a look at the website at the same time but if someone is making any changes or is asking to assistant to make some changes then it would only be available for one person at a time so the changes wouldn’t overlap and to avoid mistakes with orders. For example, if the user would allow it the software would place orders automatically on a recurring basis (i.e. monthly, fortnightly, quarterly etc.) from different providers for different products based on what the company needs at the current state. It would update the stock after the user updates its database system. With that being said, the stock has to be updated at the warehouse whenever a delivery would come in, whenever the company is using the product or whenever products are being sold individually. Furthermore, the database would allow the user to add faulty products, which can help the company get better at knowing how efficient the production is, and they can improve it based on comparing their actual month with an average of previous months, and they can add faulty products from different providers that they ordered so they can keep track when it comes to asking for returns or reimbursement as well.  In regards to the virtual assistant, the user can talk to her and ask her for example how much stock of X items does the user have and the assistant would fetch the data from the database and would respond to the user with an accurate number. In addition, the software can compare the actual stock that is available compared to what is recommended based on the demand. With that being said about the virtual assistant, the user can ask her to tell him about the predictions that the software has made and it would respond to the user according to what is asked. </p>

     <h2>Tools and Techniques</h2>
     <p style="font-size: 18px">
       This project would be done mostly using Python for its user interface such as the website or the apps for the tablets and phones and SQL language/ DBMS software systems to be able to store, retrieve and run queries on data inside of the database to be able to handle stock take and insert them and manage the tables and the database systems. For the virtual assistant, we would try to use C++ and Python as the main languages since these were the languages that were used to code the google virtual assistant on Google phones (Overview | Google Assistant SDK | Google Developers, 2022).
     </p>

     <h2>Skills Required:</h2>
     <p style="font-size: 18px">
       The skills required from the project would be a good understanding and proficiency of the Python language as well as a good foundation and proficiency in the DBMS language for the software systems. In addition, some knowledge about AI is needed able to master the virtual assistant and its responsiveness. A major hurdle is the economic and financial side of the project since we need someone who knows how to analyse markets, orders and numbers to be able to build algorithms to predict the number of items needed etc.
     </p>

     <h2>Outcome:</h2>
     <p style="font-size: 18px">
       If this project is successful, it would solve the original problem of companies having to struggle with their current stock management system and would make it easier for smaller startups and small companies to able to access better software that would reduce costs and make it more efficient having the assistance of a virtual assistant that can help with forecasting and future prediction of sales and would solve the problem of smaller companies not being able to access a market of goof software buy making our software more affordable and more accessible while being as efficient as possible.</p>
