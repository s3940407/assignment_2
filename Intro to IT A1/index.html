    <h2>
        Personal information
    </h2>

        <p>I am Joseph Elie Moussi, an Australian/Greek/Lebanese 20 year old who loves his ethnic background. I used to live between Greece and Lebanon for 10 years before moving back to Australia again after covid hit in 2020/2021. I obtained my VCE for year 12 with an economic stream from the academy of Paris (a French school). Beginning in 2021, I studied the Bachelor of Software Engineering here at RMIT for three semesters before enrolling in the Bachelor of IT that I am currently undertaking. I can fluently read and write five languages including English, French, Greek, Arabic and Turkish. It may seem a lot however living in multiple countries will force someone to learn the native language to be able to communicate better and connect with the culture of the place.

    <h2> Fun facts about me</h2>
   <ul>
       <li> I love politics and economics and every time I meet someone I tend to ask them what their background is and try to learn about their culture as much as I can.</li>
       <li> I have a pet cat, Tully and this is a picture of her(include picture). She is my fourth pet after having three birds as pets previously. 
    </li>
   </ul>

     <h2>
       Interest in IT
     </h2>

     <p>
       From a very young age, the internet sparked my curiosity and made me question how it was possible to communicate with my family in Australia while being on the other side of the globe in Greece. Internet speeds were always an area of interest for me and the different types of technologies always triggered my interest, as well as how houses were connected to the internet and how my phone is connected while not being home. I had all these questions running through my mind every time I used an electronic device. When I was 17 years old, my uncle who is in Melbourne introduced me to his job and shared his ambitions within the tech world. He used to work for IBM and Telstra and is currently working for AIA Insurance as a senior software tester where he is a part of the recruiting team for the technology department of the company. He is also currently working on his tech startup with some developers from across Asia and Australia. I have been lucky to be given the chance to join his weekly group catch-up meetings for the startup where they discuss how everything is going with the developers and where I have been exposed to how a tech company works and what developers do. I have enjoyed this and it has helped lead me to be enrolled in the bachelor of IT.
     </p>
     <p>
       I chose RMIT as my first university of choice as it is known for its leading industry connections and students that are job ready when they graduate thanks to RMIT’s different teaching models. While it may not be a traditional teaching model I have found it to be an innovative one and RMIT’s courses offer more hands-on experience and exposure unlike other universities and higher education institutions.
     </p>
     <p>
       In terms of this course, in particular, I am looking forward to learning the different aspects of the IT world and moreover, I believe that this degree will expose me to more information. I have already gained more knowledge about IT systems, since having studied the bachelor of software engineering which showed me the coding side of the IT world and has helped to show me that I am more interested in the technical, infrastructural and real-life IT side such as networking… which are my expectations of this course, as well as continuing with coding.
